## HOW TO USE 

### Setting Up The Extension 
1) In a Chrome window, go to chrome://extensions/ (leave this tab open)
2) In the upper right hand corner, toggle on the developer mode
3) Click "Load Unpacked" and upload the "Scraping Test" folder 
4) Now, go to instacart in a new tab (specfically https://www.instacart.com/store)
5) Click on the white puzzle-piece again, hit the pin next to "Scraping Test". This gives you a little blue puzzle-piece icon that you can click to activate the extension. 

### Using the Extension 

#### Some Notes: 
1) The ability to only work on instacart is hardcoded into the extension.
2) Everything prints to the console, so make sure it's open.
3) To run the extension again, you no longer need to hit refresh on BOTH the extension itself. Just close the cart tab and hit it again.
4) Every time you make a change in the extension code, save it in your code editor, refresh the extension in the extension tab, and then reload the webpage. 

#### Bugs: 
1) None
