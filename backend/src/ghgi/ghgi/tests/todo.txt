Testing TODOs

    Products
        Data validation:
            √ every entry either has a super or at least one valid Category value
            √ every root (i.e. super-less) entry has values for g, sg
        Functions:
            √ .g function
            √ .sg function
            √ lookup function
            √ mass function
            √ food_values function

            The loss and aggregation functions work

    Origins
        √ every origin entry is keyed to a canonical global name, links to a valid source id, and has a list of 4 data values
        √ the super for every origin exists

    Trigram:
        Functions:
            √ trigrams()
            √ build_indexes()
            √ match()
            √ product_index(), aka_index() load w/o error

    Parser:
        Functions:
            √ amounts() -> various ingredient inputs/output tuples return correctly
