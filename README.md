## Overview
Sexy Tofu is a tool that you can consult to understand the carbon footprint of the food you consume. 
It will give you suggestions on ways to eat more sustainably. 


## Getting started
Please refer to the [web-app README](./frontend/README.md) and [backend README](./backend/README.md) for details.


## Development road map
- We plan to release the MVP as v1.0-beta by early July, and continue to iterate the product over the summer, including more ways to input grocery list.
- Another priority is to develop the Sexy Tofu iOS app.
